### **Key Objectives of System Design**

1. **Practicality**
   - Design systems targeting specific audiences and their unique requirements.
   - Ensure the system aligns with real-world use cases and expectations.

2. **Accuracy**
   - Fulfill both functional and non-functional requirements precisely.
   - Minimize errors and gaps between the design and intended outcomes.

3. **Completeness**
   - Address all user requirements comprehensively.
   - Avoid leaving critical features or functionalities unaddressed.

4. **Efficiency**
   - Optimize resource usage to balance cost and performance.
   - Achieve low latency, high throughput, and optimal response times.

5. **Reliability**
   - Design systems to minimize failures and ensure consistent performance.
   - Support long-term stability even under adverse conditions.

6. **Optimization**
   - Optimize time and space utilization for both system and code components.
   - Streamline processes to reduce unnecessary overhead.

7. **Scalability**
   - Ensure the system can adapt to increasing demands and evolving user needs.
   - Build for long-term growth and flexibility, avoiding pitfalls like obsolescence.

### **System Design Goals and Steps**

#### **Step 1: Identify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Define core features (e.g., browsing a product catalog, placing orders, payment processing).
- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - Consider system performance, security, scalability, and reliability.

#### **Step 2: Develop a System Plan**
- Outline the architecture, components, and interfaces.
- Detail algorithms, data structures, and workflows.

#### **Step 3: Ensure Reliability and Efficiency**
- Minimize downtime and errors by robust testing and redundancy.
- Maximize performance through resource optimization and load balancing.

#### **Step 4: Focus on User-Friendliness**
- Create intuitive, clear, and accessible interfaces.
- Prioritize ease of navigation and minimal learning curves for end-users.

#### **Step 5: Address Constraints and Limitations**
- Design within hardware, software, and regulatory constraints.
- Consider compatibility and adherence to standards.

### **Example: System Design for a Small E-Commerce Website**

#### **1. Functional Requirements**
- Browse products and view details.
- Add products to a shopping cart and place orders.
- Track order statuses and send notifications.
- Process payments and handle refunds.

#### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**
- Handle high traffic and concurrent users efficiently.
- Provide rapid response times and catalog updates.
- Implement robust security measures to prevent data breaches.

#### **3. High-Level Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Web interface for browsing, ordering, and user interaction.
- **Backend**:
  - Database: Store customer, order, and product information.
  - Microservices: Handle payments, order management, and notifications.
- Communication through APIs.

#### **4. Detailed Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Built using frameworks like React or Angular, interacting with backend APIs.
- **Backend**:
  - Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured storage.
  - Microservices for specific tasks (e.g., using Stripe for payments).
- **Security**: Use HTTPS, authentication, and authorization for data safety.

#### **5. Implementation and Testing**
- Develop and test individual components.
- Integrate and test the system as a whole.
- Deploy on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) and monitor for performance.
